                When I first got into programming websites, I was really interested in helping other people get websites online and I launched a website hosting business called Hostwish Hosting back in 2011. This is a website I hold close to my heart as it is something I used to love doing. It was my favorite hobby. I attribute this to my love of programming and teaching people to learn how to program with <strong>r/CodingHelp</strong>.
                <br />
                Hostwish Hosting was built using <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://whmcs.com/" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out what WHMCS is">WHMCS</a> on the front-end. In the back-end it used MySQL and <a href="https://cpanel.net" target="_blank" title="Click here to find out what cPanel/WHM is">cPanel/WHM</a>.
