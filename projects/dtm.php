                This is a website where users can sign up to pose as celebrities to share their appreciation for characters or celebrities. This was similar to <a href="https://thefanlistings.org/" target="_blank" title="click here to read what fanlistings are">Fanlistings</a> where users could create websites from scratch. Except they could just say that "I am the Captian Jack Sparrow of the WWW" or something similar.

                This is where I got the username that I still use today, "DudeThatsErin". It is a play on this website name "Dude, That's Erin!". I have brought this back to life as of September 2023.
                <br />
                Dude, That's Me was coded using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript using a script called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100706013252/http://scripts.indisguise.org/" target="_blank">Enthusiast</a> that had an easy to use interface similar to <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> except for displaying lists with sort options and such like <a href="https://dudethats.me/list.php" target="_blank">this page</a>. This was a software that was frequently used on Fanlisting websites to display members of the fanlisting.
