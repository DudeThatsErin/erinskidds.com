          Hello! My name is Erin and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2007 when I decided to try creating a personal blog from scratch -- turns out hacking together a custom blog taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at <a href="https://riverandreef.store" target="_blank">an ecommerce startup</a>. My main focus these days is building accessible products and digital experiences at <a href="https://riverandreef.store" target="_blank">River and Reef Aquaculture, LLC</a>.
        </p>

          Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>Angular v13</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>TypeScript</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
            <li>SCSS</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
