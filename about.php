          02. About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Erin and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest is in web-based application and bot development. I started back in 2007 when I decided to try creating a personal blog from scratch -- turns out hacking together a custom blog taught me a lot about HTML &amp; CSS!
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, I currently work at River &amp; Reef Aquaculture which is an online aquaculture e-commerce startup and my position there is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Also, during my time as a freelance Full-Stack Engineer, I have developed websites and applications from scratch for clients like Travel Agent 360 and more.
        </p>

          Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>JavaScript (Node.js)</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Dart/Flutter</li>
            <li>C, C#/C#.net &amp; C++</li>
            <li>TypeScript (Angular)</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS/SCSS/SASS</li>
            <li>SQL (MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, NoSQL and more)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
